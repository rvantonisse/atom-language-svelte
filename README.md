# Language Svelte

Provides syntax highlighting for Svelte Components, directives and template blocks in Atom.

Initial extracted grammar from [ide-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-atom), by [UnwrittenFun](https://github.com/UnwrittenFun).

## Features

... Svelte syntax highlighting without the advanced IDE ...

## Why?...

I like getting color in my code. I even get distracted when there is syntax not being colored! Creating syntax themes are one thing, creating or contributing to a grammar gives the possibility to add more detailed scopes. Adding more squares to paint in! üë®‚Äçüé® On top of that, creating my own package gives me full control. ü§ì

## Roadmap to v1.0.0

- [ ] Refinement to scope naming, using naming conventions from [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html) and [TextMate](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars#naming_conventions).

  - [ ] Add support scopes on svelte specific stuff; (`svelte:xxx`, `{@html|debug}` tags, customized handlebar templating blocks `{#if} {:else}`, naming some)

  - [ ] Add / duplicate the nice tag scope naming refinment from language-html (including `text.html.basic` top-level works but may overwrite with svelte scopes)

- [ ] Tree sitter Svelte... This seems to be a bit more advanced stuff...
